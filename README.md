Hereâ€™s the updated `README.md` for your **frontend-only** Next.js project:  

```markdown
# Herkey Demo - Frontend  

This is a **Next.js** project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).  

## Getting Started  

First, set up your environment variables by creating a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and adding the following values:  

### Example `.env.local`  
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID="NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_PC="NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_PC"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="2va7e7uc2nq0ml9pvio37e7lfih7cg3n"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL"
```  

### Development Server  

To start the development server, run the following command:  
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.  

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.
